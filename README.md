# auto-post
Plan your instagram posts and publish them in a specific time.

Put all of the files you want to publish in the future in the post_files folder and then run the auto-post py file. Plan your posts, and then let the program run in the background while it's in auto-post mode. At the right time, using the python module selenium, it'll login in instagram and post your file with the specified description and title.
